# OAuth Client Restoration Guide for aiFiverr Extension

## üö® **Critical Issue: OAuth Client Deleted**

**Error**: `Error 401: deleted_client`
**Cause**: The OAuth 2.0 client was incorrectly deleted from Google Cloud Console
**Impact**: Users cannot authenticate - extension authentication is completely broken

## üîß **Step-by-Step Restoration Process**

### **Step 1: Create New OAuth 2.0 Client**

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Select project: `ai-fiverr` (Project ID: ai-fiverr)

2. **Navigate to Credentials**
   - Go to: APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Click: "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"
   - Select: "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"

3. **Configure Application Type**
   - Application type: **Web application** ‚úÖ (This is CORRECT for Chrome extensions)
   - Name: `aiFiverr Chrome Extension OAuth Client`
   - **Note**: Chrome extensions use "Web application" type, not a separate extension type

4. **Set Authorized JavaScript Origins** (Chrome Extension Specific)
   ```
   https://ai-fiverr.firebaseapp.com
   https://ai-fiverr.web.app
   ```
   **Why these origins**: Your Chrome extension uses Firebase hosting for authentication,
   so the auth flow happens on Firebase domains, not chrome-extension:// URLs.

5. **Set Authorized Redirect URIs** (Firebase Standard)
   ```
   https://ai-fiverr.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler
   ```
   **Why this URI**: Firebase Authentication handles OAuth redirects through this endpoint.

6. **Save and Copy Client ID**
   - Click "CREATE"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the new Client ID (format: `XXXXXXXXX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`)

### **Step 2: Update Firebase Authentication**

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Navigate to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select project: `ai-fiverr`

2. **Update Authentication Providers**
   - Go to: Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Click on "Google" provider
   - Update "Web SDK configuration"
   - Paste the new OAuth Client ID
   - Save changes

### **Step 3: Verify OAuth Scopes**

Ensure your OAuth client has these scopes (already fixed in code):
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile  
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
```

**Note**: We removed the problematic scopes:
- ‚ùå `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` (not needed)
- ‚ùå `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (too broad)

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Test Authentication Flow**
1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Try to authenticate with Google
3. Verify no "deleted_client" error
4. Check that user can sign in successfully

### **Check Firebase Console**
1. Go to Authentication > Users
2. Verify new sign-ins appear
3. Check that user data is properly stored

## üìã **Important Notes**

### **Why OAuth Client is Required for Chrome Extensions**
- Chrome extensions using Firebase Authentication NEED OAuth 2.0 clients
- Firebase Auth uses Google OAuth behind the scenes for "Sign in with Google"
- The OAuth client handles the authentication flow between your extension and Google
- Without it, users get "Error 401: deleted_client" when trying to sign in

### **Chrome Extension OAuth Architecture**
- **Client Type**: "Web application" (standard for Chrome extensions)
- **Auth Flow**: Extension ‚Üí Firebase Hosting ‚Üí Google OAuth ‚Üí Firebase ‚Üí Extension
- **Why Web App Type**: Chrome extensions don't have their own OAuth client type
- **Origins**: Firebase hosting domains (not chrome-extension:// URLs)

### **Why This Happened**
- OAuth clients should NEVER be deleted for production applications
- Firebase Authentication depends on the OAuth client for Google sign-in
- Deleting the client breaks all existing user authentication

### **Prevention**
- Never delete OAuth clients for production apps
- Use separate OAuth clients for development/testing
- Always test authentication after any Google Cloud Console changes

### **Chrome Web Store vs OAuth**
- The manifest.json "key" field issue has been fixed (separate issue)
- Extensions uploaded to Chrome Web Store don't need OAuth client IDs in manifest
- OAuth configuration is handled in Google Cloud Console, not in extension files

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Restoration**

1. **Test Locally**
   - Load unpacked extension
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify all features work

2. **Update Public Repository**
   - Deploy fixed version without manifest "key" field
   - Test authentication with public build

3. **Chrome Web Store Upload**
   - Upload should now work without "key" field error
   - Authentication should work for store users

4. **User Communication**
   - Inform users that authentication is restored
   - May need to clear extension data and re-authenticate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Reminder**

**DO NOT DELETE THE NEW OAUTH CLIENT** - This will break authentication again!

---

**Status**: OAuth client needs to be recreated in Google Cloud Console
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Extension authentication is completely broken
**ETA**: 10-15 minutes to restore once OAuth client is recreated
