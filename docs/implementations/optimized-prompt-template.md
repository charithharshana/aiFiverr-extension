# Prompt Template Optimization - Analysis and Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue**: Prompt template has grammar issues, unclear structure, and contributes to duplication problem  
**Current Template**: 
```
Create a short and concise project proposal (under 3000 characters) based on this  

{conversation}

extract and add Include examples urls from my previous work. Write a well-formatted proposal. No explanations.
```

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Grammar and Structure Issues**
- **Incomplete sentence**: "based on this" lacks completion
- **Awkward phrasing**: "extract and add Include examples urls" is grammatically incorrect
- **Unclear instructions**: The flow of instructions is confusing

### 2. **Duplication Contributing Factor**
- The template uses `{conversation}` which gets replaced with selected text
- When users select project details, this creates duplication since the selected text already contains the project information
- The template doesn't account for different types of selected content

### 3. **Missing Context and Clarity**
- Doesn't specify this is for Fiverr proposals
- Lacks clear structure for what should be included
- No guidance on tone or approach

## Optimized Template Options

### Option 1: **Structured Fiverr Proposal Template**
```
Create a professional Fiverr project proposal (under 3000 characters) based on the following project details:

{conversation}

Structure your proposal with:
- Brief introduction highlighting relevant experience
- Understanding of project requirements
- Proposed approach and deliverables
- Timeline and next steps
- Include relevant portfolio URLs from previous work

Write in a professional, confident tone. No explanations or meta-commentary.
```

### Option 2: **Flexible Content-Aware Template**
```
Based on the selected project information, create a compelling Fiverr proposal (under 3000 characters):

{conversation}

Requirements:
- Demonstrate clear understanding of the project needs
- Highlight relevant skills and experience
- Provide a structured approach to delivery
- Include portfolio examples where applicable
- Maintain professional, engaging tone

Format as a ready-to-send proposal without additional explanations.
```

### Option 3: **Smart Variable Template (Recommended)**
```
Create a professional Fiverr project proposal (under 3000 characters) for the following project:

{selected_text}

Your proposal should:
- Show understanding of the client's needs
- Highlight your relevant experience and skills
- Outline your approach and deliverables
- Suggest a realistic timeline
- Include portfolio URLs from similar projects

Write in a confident, professional tone. Deliver a complete, ready-to-send proposal.
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Grammar and Clarity**
- **Complete sentences**: All instructions are grammatically correct
- **Clear structure**: Bullet points make requirements easy to follow
- **Professional tone**: Appropriate for business proposals

### ✅ **Duplication Prevention**
- **Option 3 uses `{selected_text}`**: This prevents confusion with conversation context
- **Clear content source**: Explicitly states what the AI should base the proposal on
- **Flexible handling**: Works regardless of what type of content is selected

### ✅ **Enhanced Context**
- **Fiverr-specific**: Clearly indicates this is for Fiverr platform
- **Structured requirements**: Provides clear guidance on what to include
- **Professional standards**: Sets appropriate tone and expectations

### ✅ **Better User Experience**
- **Character limit reminder**: Keeps proposals within Fiverr limits
- **Ready-to-send format**: Output doesn't need additional editing
- **Portfolio integration**: Encourages including relevant work examples

## Implementation Recommendation

**Use Option 3** as it provides the best balance of:
- Clear, grammatically correct instructions
- Duplication prevention through `{selected_text}` variable
- Structured guidance for comprehensive proposals
- Professional tone appropriate for Fiverr

## Variable Usage Guide

### Recommended Variables for Proposal Templates:
- `{selected_text}` - The actual selected project details (prevents duplication)
- `{username}` - Client's name when available
- `{reply}` - Any additional context from text areas
- `{portfolio_url}` - User's portfolio URL (if stored in knowledge base)
- `{skills}` - User's key skills (if stored in knowledge base)

### Avoid These Patterns:
- Using `{conversation}` when selected text already contains project details
- Incomplete sentences or unclear instructions
- Overly complex or confusing structure
- Missing context about platform (Fiverr) or purpose (proposal)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with different content types**: Project briefs, conversation excerpts, requirement lists
2. **Verify no duplication**: Ensure selected text doesn't appear twice in output
3. **Check character limits**: Confirm proposals stay under 3000 characters
4. **Validate tone**: Ensure output is professional and appropriate for Fiverr

## Conclusion

The optimized template (Option 3) addresses all identified issues:
- ✅ Eliminates grammar and structure problems
- ✅ Prevents content duplication through smart variable usage
- ✅ Provides clear, actionable guidance
- ✅ Maintains professional standards for Fiverr proposals
- ✅ Enhances user experience with ready-to-send output

This template should significantly improve proposal quality while eliminating the duplication issue.
