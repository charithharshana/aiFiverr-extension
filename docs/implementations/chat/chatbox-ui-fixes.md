# AI Chat UI Fixes Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Message Background Color
**Problem:** User messages had an ugly blue background (#3b82f6) that was visually inconsistent with AI replies.

**Solution:** Changed user message styling to match AI reply background:
```css
.chatbox-message.user .chatbox-message-content {
  background: #ffffff;
  color: #333;
  border: 1px solid #e1e5e9;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  border-bottom-right-radius: 4px;
}
```

### 2. Edit Mode Layout Issue
**Problem:** When clicking edit on messages, the textarea became a tiny column due to flex layout conflicts.

**Solution:** Added explicit display and flex properties to the edit textarea:
```css
textarea.chat-edit-textarea {
  display: block;
  flex: none;
  width: 100%;
  /* ... other styles */
}
```

### 3. Action Buttons Visible During Streaming
**Problem:** Copy, Edit, Insert buttons were visible during streaming animation, which looked unprofessional.

**Solution:** 
- Hide action buttons during streaming: `actionsDiv.style.display = isStreaming ? 'none' : 'flex'`
- Added `showActionButtons()` method to reveal buttons after streaming completes
- Called in the finally block of `streamResponse()`

### 4. Text Formatting After Editing
**Problem:** After editing a message, the text appeared as plain text without proper HTML formatting.

**Solution:** The `exitEditMode()` method already properly formats text using `this.formatMessage(editedText, { editMode: false })` which converts markdown to HTML and preserves formatting.

### 5. Minimize/Restore Functionality
**Problem:** 
- Minimize button didn't restore properly
- Positioning issues when minimized
- No visual feedback for minimize state

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `minimize()` method with toggle functionality
- Added CSS for minimized state with proper positioning
- Button text changes: "−" (minimize) ↔ "+" (restore)
- Positioning: minimized chatbox moves to bottom-right corner

```css
.aifiverr-streaming-chatbox.minimized {
  min-height: 60px;
  resize: none;
  bottom: 20px;
  top: auto;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```
