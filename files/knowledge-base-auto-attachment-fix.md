# Knowledge Base Auto-Attachment Fix

## Problem Description

The aiFiverr extension had a critical bug where knowledge base files were being automatically attached to ALL prompts, even when:

- The custom prompt didn't specify any file attachments
- No knowledge base files were manually selected for the prompt  
- The prompt only used dual variables ({conversation} and {reply})

This caused AI responses to contain Fiverr-related content even when testing on non-Fiverr sites with prompts that should only use the selected text and reply text.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was found in multiple locations where automatic knowledge base file loading was implemented:

### 1. Text Selector (Primary Issue)
**File**: `content/fiverr/text-selector.js` (lines 1264-1275)
**Problem**: "CRITICAL FIX" comment that automatically loaded ALL knowledge base files when a prompt didn't specify any files.

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED):
if (knowledgeBaseFiles.length === 0 && window.knowledgeBaseManager) {
  const allKnowledgeBaseFiles = await window.knowledgeBaseManager.getKnowledgeBaseFiles();
  knowledgeBaseFiles = allKnowledgeBaseFiles || [];
}
```

### 2. Chat Assistant Manager (Secondary Issue)
**File**: `content/utils/chatAssistantManager.js` (lines 234-249)
**Problem**: Always loaded all knowledge base files for every chat assistant request.

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED):
let knowledgeBaseFiles = [];
if (window.knowledgeBaseManager) {
  knowledgeBaseFiles = await window.knowledgeBaseManager.getKnowledgeBaseFiles();
}
```

### 3. Universal Chat System (Intentional Behavior)
**File**: `content/ai/universal-chat-simple.js` (multiple locations)
**Status**: LEFT UNCHANGED - This is intentional behavior for the main chat interface.

The universal chat system has a two-priority system:
1. Use specifically attached files (when user manually selects files)
2. Use all knowledge base files as fallback (when no files are manually attached)

This behavior is correct for the main chat interface but was problematic when called from contexts that shouldn't auto-load files.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Text Selector Auto-Loading
**Location**: `content/fiverr/text-selector.js` (lines 1264-1271)

```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
// FIXED: Only attach knowledge base files if explicitly specified in the prompt
// Do NOT automatically load all files when prompt doesn't specify any
console.log('aiFiverr: Knowledge base files from prompt processing:', knowledgeBaseFiles.length, 'files');
if (knowledgeBaseFiles.length === 0) {
  console.log('aiFiverr: Prompt does not specify knowledge base files - no files will be attached');
} else {
  console.log('aiFiverr: Using', knowledgeBaseFiles.length, 'knowledge base files specified by prompt');
}
```

### 2. Fixed Chat Assistant Manager Auto-Loading
**Location**: `content/utils/chatAssistantManager.js` (lines 234-240)

```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
// FIXED: Do not automatically load all knowledge base files for chat assistant
// Knowledge base files should only be attached when explicitly requested by the user
// through the file attachment interface in the chat UI
console.log('aiFiverr Chat Assistant: Using message without automatic knowledge base file attachment');

const options = { stream: true };
// Note: Knowledge base files can still be attached through the chat UI's file attachment system
```

### 3. Updated Fallback Logic
**Location**: `content/utils/chatAssistantManager.js` (lines 272-274)

```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
// Fallback to regular generation without automatic knowledge base files
const fallbackOptions = { stream: false };
// Note: Knowledge base files would need to be explicitly passed if required
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Text Selector:
- ✅ Custom prompts without `knowledgeBaseFiles` property: NO files attached
- ✅ Custom prompts with `knowledgeBaseFiles: []`: NO files attached  
- ✅ Custom prompts with `knowledgeBaseFiles: ['file1', 'file2']`: Only specified files attached
- ✅ Default prompts with `knowledgeBaseFiles: 'AUTO_LOAD_ALL'`: All files attached (unchanged)

### For Chat Assistant:
- ✅ No automatic file attachment for general chat messages
- ✅ Files only attached when explicitly selected through UI
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality for manual file attachment

### For Universal Chat:
- ✅ Unchanged behavior (intentional auto-loading for main chat interface)
- ✅ Manual file attachment still works
- ✅ Fallback to all files when no manual selection (preserved)

## Testing

### Test Files Created:
1. `test/test-dual-variables-only.html` - Interactive test page
2. `test/verify-knowledge-base-fix.js` - Automated verification script
3. `test/add-test-prompt.js` - Helper to add test prompts

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Dual Variables Only**: Custom prompt with only {conversation} and {reply}
2. **Non-Fiverr Site**: Testing on Facebook or other sites
3. **No File Specification**: Prompts without knowledgeBaseFiles property
4. **Console Log Analysis**: Verify no auto-loading messages appear

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ No "getting all available knowledge base files" logs for dual-variable prompts
- ✅ Knowledge base files count shows 0 for prompts without file specifications
- ✅ AI responses contain only conversation/reply content, no Fiverr information
- ✅ No automatic file attachment occurs for text selection

## Files Modified

1. `content/fiverr/text-selector.js` - Fixed automatic file loading
2. `content/utils/chatAssistantManager.js` - Removed auto-loading for chat assistant
3. `test/test-dual-variables-only.html` - Added verification script loading
4. `docs/knowledge-base-auto-attachment-fix.md` - This documentation

## Files Created

1. `test/verify-knowledge-base-fix.js` - Comprehensive test script
2. `test/add-test-prompt.js` - Test prompt creation helper

## Verification Steps

1. Load the extension with the fixes
2. Open `test/test-dual-variables-only.html` in browser
3. Follow the test instructions to select text and use dual-variable prompts
4. Check console logs for absence of auto-loading behavior
5. Verify AI responses contain only expected content
6. Run `window.runKnowledgeBaseFixTest()` for automated verification

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact:
- ✅ Fixes unwanted knowledge base file attachment
- ✅ Improves prompt precision and relevance
- ✅ Reduces API payload size for simple prompts
- ✅ Eliminates cross-contamination between different contexts

### No Negative Impact:
- ✅ Preserves all existing file attachment functionality
- ✅ Default prompts with AUTO_LOAD_ALL still work
- ✅ Manual file selection in chat UI unchanged
- ✅ Universal chat fallback behavior preserved

This fix ensures that knowledge base files are only attached when explicitly requested, eliminating the auto-attachment bug while preserving all intended functionality.
