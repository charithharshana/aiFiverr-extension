# 🚀 aiFiverr GitHub Setup - Complete Guide

## 📋 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Public Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `aiFiverr-extension`
3. Visibility: **PUBLIC** ✅
4. Don't initialize with README
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Make Current Repository Private
1. Go to your current repository settings
2. Settings → General → Danger Zone
3. "Change repository visibility" → **Make private** ✅

### Step 3: Deploy Extension
```bash
node deploy-to-public.js
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Your Development (Private Repo)
```bash
# 1. Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# 2. When ready to release to users
node deploy-to-public.js
```

### What Happens When You Deploy:
1. ✅ Script builds clean extension (removes dev files)
2. ✅ Pushes to public repo: `charithharshana/aiFiverr-extension`
3. ✅ Creates version tag
4. ✅ Users can download immediately

### Users Download From:
- **Public repo**: https://github.com/charithharshana/aiFiverr-extension
- **Download ZIP** or clone directly

## 📁 What Goes Where

### Private Repo (charithharshana/aiFiverr) - Only You See:
- ✅ All source code
- ✅ Firebase hosting files (`firebase/hosting/`, `public/`)
- ✅ Development scripts (`deploy-to-public.js`)
- ✅ Private documentation
- ✅ Everything you're working on

### Public Repo (charithharshana/aiFiverr-extension) - Users See:
- ✅ Extension files only (`manifest.json`, `content/`, `popup/`, etc.)
- ✅ Your Firebase config (public is OK for client-side)
- ✅ Installation README
- ❌ No development files
- ❌ No private code

## 🎯 Benefits

### For You:
- 🔒 **Source code stays private**
- � **One command releases to public**
- �🔧 **Keep all dev files private**
- � **Auto-generated user documentation**

### For Users:
- 🌍 **Easy download from public repo**

## 🔑 Security (Important!)

### Firebase API Key
- ✅ **Included in public extension** (this is correct!)
- ✅ **Users authenticate through YOUR Firebase project**
- ✅ **Client-side Firebase keys are meant to be public**

### Gemini API Keys
